# Handwritten_Kmeans
Simple Kmeans algorithm executed in Python :)
Kmeans is an unsupervised algorithm, used mostly for clustering. This algorithm classifies data points based on the average distance in a class.
Each cluster has a centroid and the algorithm update each centroid based on loss until we don't see that much of a shift in the centroids' position
